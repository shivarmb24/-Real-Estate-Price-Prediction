# -Real-Estate-Price-Prediction

This project focuses on predicting real estate prices using a machine learning algorithm—Linear Regression. The objective is to build a model that accurately estimates property prices based on features like location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and other housing attributes. The dataset was cleaned through preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, removing outliers, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features. After preparing the data, a Linear Regression model was trained using Scikit-learn, achieving an R² score of approximately 0.85, indicating strong predictive performance. The model was evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand feature relationships and model performance. The project also outlines potential improvements such as trying advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost, performing cross-validation.
